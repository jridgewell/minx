I don't want to learn how to configure the site to get it running, I just want to write basic HTML. But, then I want to avoid duplicate a bunch code when I reuse a section. If only there were a way to program in JS and build static HTMLâ€¦</p><p>Minx gives you the full power of JS to create a completely static site. Each file needs to export just a `default` function in ESM, and its return value will be interpreted as Preact JSX and used to generate your HTML.</p><pre><span>website/index.mjs</span><code class="javascript">export default function Website() {
